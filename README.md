# HR Analytics - Employee Atrrition

 ## Problem Statement :  
 Employees are considered as vital asset for an Organization and if its valuable employees are leaving, it can be a great loss for a company. Our example concerns a big company that wants to understand why some of their best and most experienced employees are leaving prematurely. The company also wishes to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Here, in this project we will be having majorly two goals :

    1. We want to understand why valuable employees are leaving.
    2. We want to predict who will leave next.

Therefore, Here the project proposed deals with a HR dataset available publicly on kaggle for the purpose of Analysis for Employee Attrition and Retention.
Here, in this data set we are having records for 15000 employees having attributes: satisfaction level, latest evaluation (yearly), number of project worked on, average monthly hours, time spend in the company (in years), work accident (within the past 2 years), promotion within the past 5 years, department and salary.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to explore the variables of the hr dataset that can help in identifying the factors that led employees to leave the company. During the investigation these questions will be answered:

    • Did the employees who left receive a low salary? 
    • Is the employee's dissatisfaction a reason for there departure? 
    • Overworked, was it a negative factor?
